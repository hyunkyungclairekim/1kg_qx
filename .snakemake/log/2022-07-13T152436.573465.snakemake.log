Removing output files of failed job LD_clumping since they might be corrupted:
data/sib_gwas/filtered/ieu-b-4815_highfrq_LDclumped.txt, data/sib_gwas/filtered/ieu-b-4815_highfrq_LDclumped_transformed.txt, data/sib_gwas/filtered/ieu-b-4815_highfrq_LDclumped_transformed_rsID.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
